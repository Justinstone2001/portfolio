        <article class = "aboutMe">
            I am a current Junior at Davidson College from Cary, North Carolina. I am a Computer Science and Hispanic Studies
            double major. On top of that, I play soccer for Davidson as a center forward. I am passionate about coding, designs, music, soccer and Spanish!
            I began my coding career during my sophmore year when I began making a simple scratch program and since then have learned 
            Python, Javascript, C++, HTML CSS with D3, and am currently enrolled in a UNCC Coding Bootcamp to refine my skills.
